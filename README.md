# SeqDEFT: Sequence Density Estimation using Field Theory
This repository contains functions and a demo of the SeqDEFT method described in Chen, W.C., Zhou, J., Sheltzer, J.M., Kinney, J.B. and McCandlish, D.M.,
2021. Non-parametric Bayesian density estimation for biological sequence space with applications to pre-mRNA splicing and the karyotypic diversity of human cancer. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 118:e2025782118. [doi: 10.1073/pnas.2025782118](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2025782118).

To run the demo, simply download this repository and then execute the python notebook `20.12_SeqDEFT_demo.ipynb`. The demo will call various SeqDEFT functions from
the file `functions.py`. The sparse matrices created during each computation are stored in the directory `sparse_matrix` to facilitate future computations.

Questions or comments can be directed to Wei-Chia Chen at wcchen@ccu.edu.tw or David M. McCandlish at mccandlish@cshl.edu.
