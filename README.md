# SeqDEFT: Sequence Density Estimation using Field Theory
This repository contains functions and a demo of the SeqDEFT method publised in [Non-parametric Bayesian density estimation for biological sequence space with 
applications to pre-mRNA splicing and the karyotypic diversity of human cancer](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.25.399253) by Wei-Chia Chen, Juannan Zhou, Jason M.
Sheltzer, Justin B. Kinney, and David M. McCandlish.

To run the demo, simply download this repository and then execute the python notebook `20.12_SeqDEFT_demo.ipynb`. The demo will call various SeqDEFT functions in
the file `functions.py`. The sparse matrices created during each computation are stored in the directory `sparse_matrix` to facilitate future computations.

Questions or comments can be directed to Wei-Chia Chen at chenw@cshl.edu or David M. McCandlish at mccandlish@cshl.edu.
